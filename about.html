    <p>Barbara Sue Johnson started A Kut Above in 2002. For many years, she has worked with her mentor, Mary Bufford, for 12 years. Sue started working with Mary in 1984 and stopped in 1996. Sue started working with her at the age of 19. Ever since she was a little girl, she always wanted to own her own hair salon. She went to Crockett County Hair School and finished at Arnolds Beauty School in Milan, Tennessee. At this point, she partnered with Ms. Bufford in a hair salon called Paradise Hair Care Center. She worked at Paradise until 2002, starting her own business in Humboldt Tennessee called A Kut Above. Beginning with her new and first self-owned hair salon, she started with one barber, three stylists, and one manicurist. Two years later, she bought the other side of her shop (which was unowned) and it became a beauty and barber salon. Meanwhile, she has four barbers and four stylist. The stylists are Rosemary Martin, Sue Johnson, Gin Doaks, and Santresa Emery. Rosemary Martin, one of the stylists, began in 1986. Gin Doaks started in 1987. Santresa Emery started ten years ago. The barbers are Marcus D. Lenon (Shugaboy), Jarvis D. Hunt, and Chris Pipkin. Marcus started sixteen years ago, Jarvis started thirteen years ago, and Chris has been working at A Kut Above 6 years ago. Her mission statement is: "To Provide innovative hair care top quality stylist in healthy hair. We provide quality service in a professional and soothing atmosphere. We use proven professional products. Providing outstanding results in beautiful and healthy hair."</p>
