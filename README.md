# A Kut Above by Awesomely Kiya & Ashley

We are so, so sorry that the images and the css files are not in a folder. When we tried to put the img and css folder on GitHub, it did not work so, we had to upload the files on to GitHub individually. We went back into our code and made sure that we removed the img/ and css/ from our code since, their was not a css and img folder anymore.

A Kut Above is in Humboldt, TN and is owned by Miss Sue Davis. We choice A Kut Above as our client because one of us knew that she has always wanted a website for her business. It did take a lot of work, so far she likes our website and wants to possibly buy it from us. We made the icon and came up with the color sheme. The hardest thing was the color sheme, we changed the colors just about five times: we choose brown, green, and blue, because when we looked at the shops they both had those colors. 


Thank you, for looking at our website! 
I hope you like what you see, thanks again!
